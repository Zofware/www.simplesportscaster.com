### [Version 2.352.0.0 (April 3, 2021)]({{page.url}})

* Fix a bug that sometimes caused the game clock to stop working if you minimized and restored the app while neither recording nor streaming.
* Compute correct timeline timestamps for live stream broadcasts that are resumed after an interruption. Previously, timestamps restarted from zero after stream resumption.
* Avoid printing "Team Stats" header when exporting the timeline for a game without any stats.
* Show battery charge percentage on status bar.
* Status bar now shows "Stream Starting" in orange when a stream is in the process of starting.

#### Known Issues

* Certain apps like Zoom and OBS can "steal" the camera from SimpleSportsCaster so be careful that you don't launch other apps that might use your camera while you're in the middle of a live stream or a recording. If this happens, your live stream will go black and your recording will stop.
* On Windows versions prior to May 2020 (build 19041 aka 2004), pure black pixels in logo images may become transparent. To avoid this, either upgrade to the latest version of Windows or avoid using pure black in your team logos. For example, use #010101 instead.
* The SVG support in Windows isn't always perfect. If your SVG file doesn't show up after you import it, then you might be able to get it to work by making a few simple edits to the SVG file in Notepad or another text editor. For example, look near the top of the file to see if the `svg` tag uses the `width` and `height` properties. If it does, then try removing them and see if the file imports successfully.
* The scoreboard and game clock don't redraw while SimpleSportsCaster is minimized. Game time still advances normally but it just doesn't show on the screen until SimpleSportsCaster is restored from the minimized state.
