### [Version 1.1.144.0 (October 17, 2019)]({{page.url}})
* Fix numerous memory leaks, some of which could cause old instances of the game screen to remain active.
* Fix a bug that would sometimes cause the game clock to go blank when desktop screen scaling wasn't set to 100%.
* Avoid setting live stream metadata if the stream didn't complete successfully. This should help prevent the metadata from accidentally being applied to the default YouTube broadcast.
* To help diagnose and fix live stream issues in the future, add more diagnostic logging of stream events, status, and performance.
