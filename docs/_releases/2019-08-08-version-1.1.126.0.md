### [Version 1.1.126.0 (August 8, 2019)]({{page.url}})
* Synchronize keyboard shortcuts between all devices sharing the same Microsoft Account.
* Expose video encoder profile setting for recording and streaming so users can fine-tune the balance between video quality and power consumption.
* Prevent accidental deletion of database records that are referenced by other records. For example, you can no longer delete a logo image that is current being used by one or more liveries.
* Disable wireless display support to reduce video preview startup time.
