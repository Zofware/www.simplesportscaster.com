### Version 1.1.172.0 (28 December 2019)

#### Keyboard Shortcuts

Support for keyboard shortcuts has been greatly improved. Now there is a Shortcuts page on the in-game screen where you can see all the commands that can have keyboard shortcuts assigned to them. You can assign shortcuts on the Shortcuts page or you can do it on the Game page by right-clicking or long pressing on any of the buttons and switches there.

One improvement in the new shortcut system is that a shortcut can now trigger a command even if the button for the command is not visible. The old shortcut implementation wasn't reliable because it required the associated button to be visible and enabled, which wasn't always guaranteed.

The new shortcut system will not allow more than one command to share the same keyboard shortcut. If you assign an existing shortcut to a new command, the assignment to the previous command is removed.

Shortcut assignments are saved per-user and will roam to any other machine where the same user logs in. Note: Shortcuts that you assigned in previous versions of SimpleSportsCaster are not preserved so you'll need to reassign your shortcuts after upgrading.

#### Overlaid Preview
When running in portrait mode, the screen can sometimes get a little cramped and it's difficult to combine a large video preview with large buttons. If this describes your situation, try the new Overlaid preview which combines a full size video preview with semi-transparent buttons overlaid on top.

Because the buttons float on top of the video you can use the Button Size slider to make them much larger than you can using the Split Screen preview.

You can completely hide the buttons by tapping anywhere on the screen that doesn't have a button covering it. To bring the buttons back again, just tap anywhere on the video preview.

#### Game Clock
This release contains a few changes to the game clock. During pregame, the large scoreboard will show the time remaining until kickoff. In the League settings, there is now an option to use a countdown clock for any league that needs it such as NCAA college games.

#### Game Page Improvements
There are numerous minor improvements to the Game page on the in-game screen.
* Add recording and streaming toggle switches so you no longer have to switch to the Video page to start and stop recording or streaming.
* Show the most recent event next to the Undo button so you know what will be undone when you tap the button.
* Add a Save button for tracking saves by the keeper. 
* Add a Handball button to the Infractions section.
* Rename penalty shootout "goal" to "score" to recognize the fact that successful penalties during a shootout are not counted as goals.
* Only show the shootout buttons during a shootout. Also hide the other buttons during a shootout.
* Move red and yellow card buttons into a new Cards section.
* Add up and down buttons to the Button Size and Opacity sliders.

* Add a Buy Now button to bottom app bar.
* In the free version, automatically display a friendly reminder to purchase the full version of the app.

* Add a help link to the About dialog.
* Remove leading zeros from some game times.
* Add milliseconds to event time formatting.
* Set default privacy for auto broadcasts to public (was private).
