#### Customizable Video Watermark

You can now customize the video watermark in paid versions of SimpleSportsCaster (or when you unlock the free beta).

The customization settings are at the bottom of the Video tab on the game screen. You can choose between several built-in SimpleSportsCaster logos or you can import your own custom image. You can also change the size and opacity of the watermark.

#### Known Issues
* The SVG support in Windows isn't always perfect. If your SVG file doesn't show up after you import it, then you might be able to get it to work by making a few simple edits to the SVG file in Notepad or another text editor. For example, look near the top of the file to see if the `svg` tag uses the `width` and `height` properties. If it does, then try removing them and see if the file imports successfully.
* The scoreboard and game clock don't redraw while SimpleSportsCaster is minimized. Game time still advances normally but it just doesn't show on the screen until SimpleSportsCaster is retored from the minimized state.
