### Version 1.1.184.0 (15 January 2020)
* Improve styling of pivot header in overlaid preview mode.
* Package updates: Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT 2.0.200115.8 and Telerik.UI.for.UniversalWindowsPlatform 1.0.1.8

#### Known Issues
* The SVG support in Windows isn't always perfect. If your SVG file doesn't show up after you import it, then you might be able to get it to work by making a few simple edits to the SVG file in Notepad or another text editor. For example, look near the top of the file to see if the `svg` tag uses the `width` and `height` properties. If it does, then try removing them and see if the file imports successfully.
* The scoreboard and game clock don't redraw while SimpleSportsCaster is minimized. Game time still advances normally but it just doesn't show on the screen until SimpleSportsCaster is retored from the minimized state.
