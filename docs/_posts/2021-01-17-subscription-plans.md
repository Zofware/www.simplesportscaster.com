Starting in February 2021, we'll be introducing a number of subscription options for SimpleSportsCaster. There will be two subscription levels, Basic and Deluxe, available for purchase.

The Basic subscription unlocks live streaming and recording without any time limits. The Deluxe subscription unlocks all of the advanced features of SimpleSportsCaster. Each subscription level will also have a free trial so you can try things out before you buy.

Here are the planned feature and pricing options:
