Starting in February 2021, we introduced a number of subscription options for SimpleSportsCaster. There are two subscription levels, Basic and Deluxe, available for purchase.

The Basic subscription unlocks live streaming and recording without any time limits. The Deluxe subscription unlocks all of the advanced features of SimpleSportsCaster. Each subscription level has a free trial so you can try things out before you buy.

Here are the feature and pricing options:

At the same time, the beta test period has come to a close. Thanks to everyone who gave us feedback during the beta!

If you want to use SimpleSportsCaster in your club, school, or business, we have other licensing options available, including volume options.

Thanks and happy filming!
