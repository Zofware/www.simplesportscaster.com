### Version 1.1.209.0 (10 February 2020)
* Add support for license keys.
* Add support for concurrent user limits. The beta will limit you to running one instance of SimpleSportsCaster at a time per Microsoft account.
* Disable YouTube live stream health queries to avoid exceeding YouTube API quota limits. More info [here](https://twitter.com/zofware/status/1226380524861542401).

#### Known Issues
* The SVG support in Windows isn't always perfect. If your SVG file doesn't show up after you import it, then you might be able to get it to work by making a few simple edits to the SVG file in Notepad or another text editor. For example, look near the top of the file to see if the `svg` tag uses the `width` and `height` properties. If it does, then try removing them and see if the file imports successfully.
* The scoreboard and game clock don't redraw while SimpleSportsCaster is minimized. Game time still advances normally but it just doesn't show on the screen until SimpleSportsCaster is retored from the minimized state.
* The scoreboard overlay graphics don't align properly when the video capture mode doesn't have a resolution with a 16:9 aspect ratio.
