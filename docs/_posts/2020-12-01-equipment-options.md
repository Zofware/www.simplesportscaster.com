One of the great things about SimpleSportsCaster is that it doesn't take too much investment in equipment to get started. In fact, you might already own some of what you need. For example, if you have a Windows 10 laptop or tablet that can play video games then it's probably got more than enough power to run SimpleSportsCaster too. You can use the camera built right into your laptop or tablet to film your games. With your phone as a wi-fi hotspot you can live stream your games to your audience. No other equipment required!

Here are several other [laptops and tablets](/help/machines) that we've used with SimpleSportsCaster.

### Capturing Better Video

Maybe you already have a camcorder or other camera that can output video over HDMI. You can start using your camera with SimpleSportsCaster by adding a small video capture device and some cables. For about $130 you can buy an Elgato Cam Link that will connect your camera to your laptop or tablet via USB 3. Other [video capture options](/help/capture-devices) are available too.

### Going All Out

If you want to go all out and build a no-compromises rugged, customized tablet that can do it all and run for hours and hours, then [check out this system](/project/rugged-tablet) we built for [Seattle United FC](https://www.seattleunited.com). It makes the perfect companion for the club's Hi-Pod camera systems and adds a scoreboard and game clock to their game film while letting the families and fans watch live via YouTube. Check out [Seattle United on YouTube](http://video.seattleunited.soccer) for some of the club's recent broadcasts.
