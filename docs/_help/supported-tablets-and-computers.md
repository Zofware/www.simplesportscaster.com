SimpleSportsCaster supports tablets and computers running Windows 10 that have hardware video encoders. Some tablets and computers will seem to run SimpleSportsCaster fine for a few minutes but if they don't have adequate cooling then they get too hot and performance suffers.

Please leave a comment at the bottom of this page if you know of other tablets and computers that work (or don't work) with SimpleSportsCaster and we will update the table. Thank you!

## Additional Notes

### Microsoft Surface Pro LTE
In moderate temperatures (below 85&deg; F) this tablet is a champ for simultaneous recording and streaming at 1080p60. However, on warmer days it can overheat, especially if exposed to the sun. To prevent overheating, keep it in the shade and use a USB fan. For some ideas, see [Heat Part 2]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-08-23-heat-part-2 %}).
