## Additional Notes

### AJA U-TAP HDMI
* This device supports a huge number of resolutions and frame rates up to 1080p60.
* It can scale video from your camera to a different resolution before sending it to your computer.
* Very reliable.

### ShuOne HSV323
* Might have problems with audio/vidio sync with cameras that output 59.94 frames per second. This might also be bug in SimpleSportsCaster but more investigation is necessary.
* In limited testing had trouble with dropped frames but, again, more investigation is necessary.
