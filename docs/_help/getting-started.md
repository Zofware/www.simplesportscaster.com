### Battery Power Warning
Ensure your tablet/laptop and camera is fully charged and that it can cover a full game.  Keep in mind, that battery performance is degraded in cold weather.

***IMPORTANT:*** It is highly recommended that you utilize an external battery to power your tablet/laptop.  Rendering of video is very GPU and processor intensive and therefore will drain your battery quickly.  In addition, your livestream can be negatively impacted if your system’s power management steps down its processing power as your device’s internal battery depletes.


### Customizing the scoreboard

1. From the ***Start*** tab locate the section labeled ***“Choose a game”*** and click the ***Edit*** button (shaped like a pencil).

3. Under the ***”Choose recording settings”*** you will find the settings that will determine the quality and size of the file that records to your laptop.  It is best practice to match the ouput of your camera so to prevent your device from having to any additional conversions.

***IMPORTANT:*** We highly suggest that you test several different settings (slowly scaling up) prior to your actual first livestreamed game day.

***NOTE:*** Recording a video file to your laptop is optional and should only be done by those users whose hardware exceeds the minimum hardware requirements for the application.
