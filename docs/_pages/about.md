Features:
* Customize the scoreboard with team colors and logos.
* Live stream to [YouTube](https://youtube.com) or any other service supporting RTMP.
* Record high definition video at up to 1080p at 60 frames per second or 2160p at 30 frames per second.
* Tag important events during the game so you can quickly find them while reviewing your footage later.
* Show game information on the bottom third of the screen during pre-game, half time, or after the match.
* Experimental: Keep your [TeamSnap Live!](https://www.teamsnap.com/teams/features/teamsnap-live) scoreboard in sync with the video scoreboard.
