Features:
* Customize the scoreboard with team colors and logos.
* Live stream to [YouTube](https://youtube.com) or any other service supporting RTMP.
* Record high definition video at up to 1080p and 60 frames per second.
* Tag important events during the game so you can quickly find them while reviewing your footage later.
* Show game information on the bottom third of the screen during pre-game, half time, or after the match.
* Experimental: Keep your [TeamSnap Live!](https://www.teamsnap.com/teams/features/teamsnap-live) scoreboard in sync with the video scoreboard.

## Beta Testing

SimpleSportsCaster is currently in beta testing. Everyone is encouraged to test the app, report bugs and make feature requests on the [contact page](/contact).  

The free version of SimpleSportsCaster puts a watermark over the upper-right corner of your video. While SimpleSportsCaster is in public beta testing, you can remove the watermark for free by clicking it and signing into the Microsoft Store to unlock the full version. The unlock will last for 30 days at which point you'll have to unlock again.  

In the future, SimpleSportsCaster will use a subscription model to unlock the full version. Pricing to be determined.
